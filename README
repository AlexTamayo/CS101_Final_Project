This is a WRC racing game I made for my last project of the first module of the Computer Science course in Codecademy. At this time (2022 Aug) this is the longest program I've ever written and I'm actually quite proud of the result. I'm looking forward to being able to look back on it and reflect on how much I've learnt since. 

In the mean time, I hope you enjoy playing this game. It is very basic, but I have had fun setting records in it and I hope you do too.
